WINDOWS TO LINUX

architecture:
    powershell with System.Windows.Forms
    powershell core for Linux.  MVP GUI pattern.
    powershell as DSL for config
    bundle as exe with elevated privs
    monkeypatching by plugins to fix issues.
    Automated testing
        Can't really do this until we have pre-MVP
        Test hardware uses HDD
        Triggered by push to master
        Everything will be set up to use an http proxy that will cache downloads.
        Start with full drive image backup, and separate C: partition image backup.
        Create report of config of partitions and bootmgr
        Windows script runs on boot.
            Waits for network trigger to start install.
            Auto start script downloads current code and runs it with default settings.
            Any error or warning is recorded.
            At end, reboot to Linux
        Linux post-install script
            chroot into tmpfs file system
            repartition C: + linux back to original
            recover backup image to partition
            Inject auto-run script
            Change boot manager to original
            verify partiion table and bootmgr is idential to start
            reboot

* Ask:
  - I already have Linux installed in a partition
  - I Only have Windows installed.
  - This is a second attempt to use this program
* scan
  - load all plugins into array
  - for each profile, scan all plugins.  Remember duplicate matches.
* ask questions
  - Questions for installers
  - User file tree to copy
* Prepare HD: checkpoint, clean up, backup, defrag, repartition
* start linux VM: install virtualbox, extensions, download iso, automate install, install VM, launch
* Installs with progress
  - apt-get update + upgrade
  - Copy files
  - Install packages

Use cases
* Windows to dual-boot Ubuntu  (default goal)
* Ubuntu VM install.   Install Ubuntu into a VM.
* Ubuntu is already installed in a partition.  Export Windows config.
* Ubuntu is on a remote machine.  Export Windows config over ssh.

Post-Install use cases
* Clean:  Re-run clean, and restore pagefile, hiberfil.sys, etc.
* Sync:   Sync changes from Windows to Ubuntu
* Hop:    Change distro, reinstall apps.
* Revert: Remove Ubuntu and go back to original configuration.
* Commit: Delete C: partition, grow linux to fill its space.

Cleanup

Before we begining we recommend cleaning up your hard drive to free up space for the install
and to temporarily get unmoveable files out of the way.

[x] Disable swap file
[x] Disable hibernate file
[x] Remove restore points
[x] Remove dumps
[x] Clean temp
[x] Defragment drive

Swap and hibernate will be reset to their original values after the install is complete.

Version 0.1
* Many assumptions: Win 10, single C:, virtualbox, dual boot, Mint cinnamon
* If no "linux" partition, create it with powershell and bcdedit
* Download and Install ISO to partition.
* Launch in VM and then force launch of installer.
* Bash script for installing windows apps and transfering data.

Side idea:  ultimate distro hopper
* Tiny linux distro boots
* Grub like menu to choose which distro
* Menu Option to add one.
* Common home partition.   contains info on packages to install.
* Other options: manage partitions, create recovery usb, recover windows.




------ FIRST TRY TO INSTLAL LINUX
Full image backup using Clonezilla
Full backup of all partitions from within Windows and do a test restore.
Defrag and Repartition using Powershell.  Shrink C: and create linux-system and linux-home partitions.
Install Linux in VirtualBox on the Linux partitions.  Automate the whole thing with powershell and Ubuntu kickstart.
Use Windows boot manager instead of Grub2 for boot menu.
Boot to Ubuntu and replace Win boot manager with Grub2 (if possible)
And then wipe it all and install Void Linux as that's what I want to use.  I might buy another cheap laptop for these experiments.

On Linux, create VirtualBox VM image using WIndows' raw partition.

Final testing:
Reboot to test all scenarios:  Linux w/Windows VM, Windows w/Linux VM.
Restore back to beginning.

You can first disable System Protection, System restore files, Fast startup, Hibernation mode, kernel memory dump, and page files as least temporarily.

Install Linux from Windows?

Looking for feedback.

For fun, I'm going to experiment with installing dual-boot Linux on a Windows Laptop.  I know it's generally considered not possible due to such a thing, but I'd like to at least try.  Where do you think I'd have the biggest issues with this plan?:
